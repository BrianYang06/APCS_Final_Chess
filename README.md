# APCS_Final_Chess
### Cd Projekt Chess: Brian Yang and Anson Wong
### Brief Description:
Our plan is to create a chess game that follows most of the standard rules of the game in Processing. All of the gameplay such as the movement of chess pieces and forfeiting will be done using the keyboard inputs. Complicated game outcomes like stalemate with many pieces remaining and moves like en passant and castling will be nice to have features but will not be a priority. What will be a priority is by making a playable game of chess that closely resembles actual chess.<br>
### [Prototype Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1grKeZeHldpE-cCBicYMR9spisFDGOOUnQsajPrm6ZLQ/edit)
### Compile/Run Instructions:
To be run in processing. To start the game, enter in the name of the first and second player. To play, follow standard rules of chess and type in the location of the piece you want to move and then where you want to move it to.
