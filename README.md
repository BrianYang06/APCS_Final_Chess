# APCS_Final_Chess

    Our plan is to create a chess game that follows most of the standard rules of the game in Processing. All of the gameplay such as the movement of chess pieces and forfeiting will be done using the keyboard inputs. Complicated game outcomes like stalemate with many pieces remaining and moves like en passant and castling will be nice to have features. These aspects of the game will not be a priority. What will be a priority is by making a playable game of chess that closely resembles actual chess.
