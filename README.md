# APCS_Final_Chess
**Cd Projekt Chess:** Brian Yang and Anson Wong <br>
**Brief Description:** Our plan is to create a chess game that follows most of the standard rules of the game in Processing. All of the gameplay such as the movement of
chess pieces and forfeiting will be done using the keyboard inputs. Complicated game outcomes like stalemate with many pieces remaining and moves like en passant and 
castling will be nice to have features but will not be a priority. What will be a priority is by making a playable game of chess that closely resembles actual chess.<br>
